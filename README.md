# Strata Vid

**Browser-based video editor for stitching run videos with GPX data**

Strata Vid is a client-side video editing application that combines multiple video clips with GPS track data to create synchronized, exportable videos. Everything runs in your browser—no server required.

## Status: Early Development 🚧

This project is in active development. Core infrastructure is in place, but many features are not yet functional.

**What works**:
- ✅ Type system and state management (Zustand)
- ✅ Asset loading (videos, GPX files)
- ✅ Component scaffolding (UI layout)
- ✅ Build system (Vite + React 19 + TypeScript)

**What's in progress**:
- 🟨 Video playback and preview
- 🟨 Timeline editing (drag, resize clips)
- 🟨 GPX/map synchronization

**What's planned**:
- ❌ Export to MP4 (scaffolded but untested)
- ❌ Advanced editing (transitions, effects)
- ❌ Audio support
- ❌ Project save/load

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 26 or higher (strata-react needs it; `.nvmrc` names it)

## Testing

This project follows a strict testing structure:

- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/`) - Fast, isolated, use mocks. Run with `npm run test:unit`
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/`) - Slower, end-to-end. Run with `npm run test:integration`
- **Coverage** - Calculated from unit tests only. Target: >80%

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for guidelines.

## Contributing

This is currently a personal project, but contributions are welcome once core features are stable.

### Development Workflow

1. **Pick a task** from [Implementation Roadmap](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)
   - Start with **Section A: Playback Foundation** for MVP
   - Tasks organized by section with clear dependencies

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/section-a-task-1
   ```

3. **Implement and test**
   - Write unit tests as you go
   - Run `npm run test:watch` in a separate terminal

4. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement playback controls (Section A, Task 2)"
   git push -u origin feature/section-a-task-1
   ```

5. **Create PR** (when ready)

## Roadmap

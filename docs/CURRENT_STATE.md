# Current State Assessment

## What Actually Works

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- **Type System**: Complete type definitions for Assets, Clips, Tracks, Project settings
- **State Management**: Zustand store with immer middleware, organized into slices
- **Build System**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 configured
- **Project Structure**: Clean separation of concerns (components, services, store, utils)

### ✅ Basic Components
- **App Layout**: Grid-based panel layout (Library, Preview, Metadata, Timeline)
- **Component Scaffolding**: All major UI components exist as files
- **Asset Loading**: Service can load video files and extract metadata using mediabunny
- **GPX Parsing**: Can parse GPX files and extract track points and stats

### 🟨 Partially Working

#### Library Panel
- ✅ Can display asset list
- ✅ File upload button exists
- ✅ Asset selection works
- ✅ Asset thumbnails/previews
- ❌ No asset management (delete, rename)

#### Preview Panel
- ✅ Container renders
- ✅ VideoPlayer component exists
- ✅ Can render active clips
- ✅ Video playback works with sync
- ✅ Transport controls visible and functional
- ❌ Overlay rendering incomplete

#### Timeline Panel
- ✅ Container structure exists
- ✅ Track lanes render
- ✅ Basic zoom controls
- ✅ Playhead visible and draggable
- ❌ Drag-and-drop not fully functional
- ❌ Clip resize handles not working
- ❌ No snapping or collision detection
- ❌ Ruler exists but may need refinement

#### Metadata Panel
- ✅ Shows comprehensive asset info (thumbnails, resolution, duration)
- ✅ GPX-specific metadata display (distance, elevation)
- ❌ No editing capabilities

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

#### Map Integration
- ✅ MapPanel component fully implemented with Leaflet
- ✅ GPX overlay rendering working with track lines and current position marker
- ✅ Time-to-coordinate synchronization (D1, D3, D4) implemented with binary search
- ✅ Auto-sync using video metadata/creation time
- ✅ Map styling (tiles, colors, zoom) editable in Metadata Panel
- ❌ Map tile rendering in export compositor untested (Section E)

#### Export Pipeline
- ✅ ExportModal UI with Settings (Resolution, FPS, Bitrate)
- ✅ Compositor and ExportManager fully implemented
- ✅ Video encoding pipeline via mediabunny (WebCodecs)
- ✅ Progress feedback and Cancellation
- ✅ Map rendering logic (on-the-fly tile loading)
- ⚠️ Integration tests run in JSDOM with mocks for WebCodecs and Canvas (full E2E browser test recommended)

#### User Experience
- No project save/load
- No undo/redo
- ✅ Error messages (Toast notifications)
- ✅ Loading states (Overlay)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Basic playback)
- ✅ Tooltips
- ❌ Help modal

## Critical Gaps for MVP

1. **Video Playback**: Need working play/pause controls and actual video rendering
2. **Timeline Interaction**: Clips need to be visible and interactive on timeline
3. **Basic Editing**: Must be able to trim and arrange clips
4. **Playhead Sync**: Timeline playhead must sync with preview
5. **Transport Controls**: Play, pause, stop, scrub must work
6. ✅ **Export**: Must be able to generate actual MP4 file (Implemented)

## Technical Debt

- Many `@ts-ignore` comments suggest type issues
- Error handling is minimal
- No logging or debugging infrastructure
- Mediabunny integration untested in actual browser

## Strengths to Build On

1. **Solid Architecture**: The overall structure is sound
2. **Good Separation**: Store slices, services, and components are well organized
3. **Modern Stack**: React 19, Zustand, Vite are excellent choices
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types are comprehensive
5. **Test Structure**: Test files exist, just need implementation to test

## Next Steps

See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed task breakdown organized by section.
Priority: **Section A - Playback Foundation** to get basic video playback working.
